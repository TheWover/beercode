# beercode
Free beerware-quality code in exchange for beer money (if you are so inclined). ;-) 

I usually try to publish clean, well-documented projects and only do so when they are at a usable state. My code remains in private repos until it is worth sharing with others. Consider this repo the dumping ground for everything that violates that principle. :-P Anything that is too big for a Gist, and too much of a PoC for its own repo.
